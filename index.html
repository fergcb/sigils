        <h1>Suyerin Sigils</h1>
        <p>This page describes the glyphs, or sigils, which constitute the written form of the Suyerin language, a constructed language from my D&D campaign setting, <a href="https://auriin.fergcb.uk/">Auriin</a></p>
        <p>Each glyph consists of one or more connected brush-strokes, navigating a 7-point grid.</p>

        <h2>Suyerin Abjad</h2>
        <p>The Suyerin Abjad was a collection of sigils, used to represent the consonant sounds of the Old Taspian language. These sigils 13 were derived from simplified Pre-Suyerin pictograms, which represented words starting with the consonant that the resulting sigil corresponded to.</p>
